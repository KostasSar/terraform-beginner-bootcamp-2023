### Login Issue Fix

When trying to login to Terraform Cloud I discovered that all the login issues we faced with GitPod in the videos can be solved by pressing `CTRL+c`.
This was stopping the prompts and menus generated and just pointed to a prompt asking for the token.
After pasing, I go the **Successful login** message!
No need for workarounds or the additional bash script.
